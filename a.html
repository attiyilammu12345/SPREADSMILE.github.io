        <b> HOPE </b>Forced to stay indoors with schools being shut down, children became one of the worst sufferers of the pandemic. While many children shifted to digital mode of learning, the less privileged children did not have similar access to technology and their education came to a halt.
<br>
 With one year's gap in education, over 24 million children* globally are at the risk of dropping out of school. In India, 5.3 percent of rural children aged 6-10 years have not enrolled in school this year, compared to 1.8 percent in 2018*

 
<br>
Through its Shiksha Na Ruke initiative, Smile Foundation has been making an effort to help less privileged children continue their education through a blended learning approach during the pandemic.

 
<br>
From creating innovative learning material at home to borrowing smart phones to study online, and attending cluster classes in the communities wearing masks, these children are stopping at nothing. Despite the odds, they have not given up on their education and their dreams. Then, how can we?

 
<br><b>
Join hands with #ShikshaNaRuke to ensure that education does not stop for any child.</b>
